		<p class="bio">
			I'm a finance enthusiast, a web and mobile developer, life learner, sports fan, and optimistic DO'er. I'm very casual and I pride myself on an easy-going and honest personality.  I work hard to keep a strong work-ethic, open mind, and aspire to make my own Jobsian "dent in the world."  I don't believe in intelligence, I believe in grit and creativity.  And most importantly, I believe the way to truly understand something is to write it on the web in front of 2 billion possible critics.

			With that I should mention.  I'm not sure that I always believe what I say, but I write it here nonetheless.  Helps me think.  Even more so, I appreciate a good argument, so please leave a comment if I get too out of hand.  Or even a little, but please be civilized.  I know my views on the obsolete nature of the box-spring are not always welcomed.

		<p class="bio">
			I currently work in finance for a telecom company in Santa Barbara, CA.  I am a hobbyist developer.  Most of my web development has been under a MEAN stack.  I have an affinity for ^([*]?)JS, and work regularly with Python, and objective-C for iOS.  I really enjoy my time programming and look forward to exploring the possibilities.
		</p>
		<p class="bio">
			I am open to new opportunities and would appreciate the opportunity to work with you.  Please reach out to me with any questions/comments/concerns.
